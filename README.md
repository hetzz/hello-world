## GSOC_Scrape

* My first try into the world of automation led me to scrape the GSOC website Due to my keen interest in Open Source.
* Used Jupyter Notebook to get acknowledged with the importance of unit testing.
* [GSOC.csv](https://github.com/hetzz/hello-world/blob/master/GSOC_Scrape/GSOC.csv) file will have the details of all the organisation of GSOC 2019.
