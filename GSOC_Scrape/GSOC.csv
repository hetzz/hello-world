Apertium,http://wiki.apertium.org,"Apertium is a shallow-transfer machine translation system, which uses finite state transducers for all of its lexical transformations, and hidden Markov models and/or constraint grammars for part-of-speech tagging or word category disambiguation.
Existing machine translation systems available at present are mostly commercial, use proprietary technologies, which makes them very hard to adapt to new usages; furthermore, they use different technologies across language pairs, which makes it very difficult, for instance, to integrate them in a single multilingual content management system. Finally, most of them are not available for most of the languages in the world, as they rely heavily on resources that are not available for them.
Apertium uses a language-independent specification, to allow for the ease of contributing to Apertium, more efficient development, and enhancing the project's overall growth.
At present, Apertium has released more than 40 stable language pairs, delivering fast translation with reasonably intelligible results. Being an open-source project, Apertium provides tools for potential developers to build their own language pair and contribute to the project."

Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society,https://cyber.harvard.edu,"Exploring cyberspace, sharing in its study, and helping pioneer its development.
The Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University was founded to explore cyberspace, share in its study, and help pioneer its development. We represent a network of faculty, students, fellows, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and virtual architects working to identify and engage with the challenges and opportunities of cyberspace.
We investigate the real and possible boundaries in cyberspace between open and closed systems of code, of commerce, of governance, and of education, and the relationship of law to each. We do this through active rather than passive research, believing that the best way to understand cyberspace is to actually build out into it.
Our faculty, fellows, students, and affiliates engage with a wide spectrum of Net issues, including governance, privacy, intellectual property, antitrust, content control, and electronic commerce. Our diverse research interests cohere in a common understanding of the Internet as a social and political space where constraints upon inhabitants are determined not only through the traditional application of law, but, more subtly, through technical architecture (""code"").
As part of our active research mission, we build, use, and freely share open software platforms for free online lectures and discussions. We also sponsor gatherings, ranging from informal lunches to international conferences, that bring together members of our diverse network of participants to swap insights – and sometimes barbs – as they stake out their respective visions for what the Net can become. We also teach, seeking out online and global opportunities, as well as supporting the traditional Harvard Law School curriculum, often in conjunction with other Harvard schools and MIT.

CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, https://home.cern) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.
The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.
The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!"

CHAOSS,https://chaoss.community,"Our open source ecosystem is growing. More developers and companies engage in open source every year because it is cost efficient, it enables rapid innovation, and it promotes open standards. Open source is becoming the default for software development.
The importance of open source software is no longer in question. However, its importance raises important questions about the open source ecosystem. Open source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact. Open source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members. Open source companies want to know which communities and software to engage with, communicate the impact the organization has on the community, and evaluate the work of their employees within open source. Open source foundations want to identify and respond to community needs, evaluate the impact of their work, and promote communities.
In response to these issues, the CHAOSS community is developing metrics, methodologies, and software for expressing open source project health and sustainability.

Chapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a ""coforall"" loop, which is similar to a ""for"" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.
Data and Task Locality
When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.
Multiresolution Philosophy
Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.
Modern Language Features
Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.
Interoperability
Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features."
Checker Framework,https://checkerframework.org/,"We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality. We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the Checker Framework.
The Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production. It is based on the idea of pluggable type-checking. Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.
Java's type system prevents some bugs, such as int count = ""hello"";. However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.
The Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's. The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool: it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program. Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use. It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow. We have created around 20 new type systems, and other people have created many more.
The Checker Framework is popular: it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small. It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code. The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature. Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne. With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project: everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration. We welcome your contribution!
Please see our ideas list for how to get started and how to ask questions."

"CLiPS, University of Antwerp",https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips,"The Computational Linguistics & Psycholinguistics Research Group of the University of Antwerp (CLiPS, http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be) focuses on applications of statistical and machine learning methods, trained on corpus data, to explain human language acquisition and processing data, and to develop automatic text analysis systems that are accurate, efficient, and robust enough to be used in practical applications.
There are 3 subgroups to CLiPS: (1) the sociolinguistics group studies language variation in different demographic groups. The (2) psycholinguistics group studies the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on (3) the computational linguistics group.
Current research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.
Over the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes."

Computational Biology @ University of Nebraska-Lincoln,http://helikarlab.org,"Our team works at the interface of computer science, biology, and mathematics by applying computational approaches to the seas of data in life sciences research. One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. For example, our web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell.
Our technologies have broad impact in education: Traditional didactic and textbook-based learning formats utilized in many life sciences courses create an environment that limits student ability to develop highly needed technical skills and fully conceptualize the complex and dynamic nature of biology and diseases. To address these challenges, our software technologies enable students ranging from high schools to undergraduate and graduate levels to learn about biology and diseases using by building, simulating, breaking, and re-analyzing computational models of these biological systems.
Other technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc. Our group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point."

D Programming Language,https://dlang.org,"D is a programming language with an emphasis on powerful metaprogramming facilities on top of a robust, efficient core. Idiomatic D programs are commonly as fast as hand-optimized C code, while being reportedly shorter and easier to write, read, and change. A gradual approach to memory safety allows safe programs to be largely automatically checked, whilst relying on small and fast manually-verified primitives.
Metaprogramming in the D language relies on three core features. First, compile-time evaluation allows user code to evaluate most D code (except calls into opaque functions or certain casts) during compilation. This allows for unparalleled compile-time processing abilities, without the need to learn a different metalanguage. Second, static introspection allows D artifacts (such as modules, types, functions) to be inspected during compilation. This allows for component designs that adapt to one another at assemblage time, eliminating the rigidity of fixed interfaces - a paradigm becoming increasingly known as ""Design by Introspection"". Third, the D language allows strings computed during compilation to be fed back to the compiler. This allows arbitrarily complex code to be built from compact specifications such as regular expressions, EBNF/PEG grammars, SQL, automata, and many other DSLs. Each of these three pillars is enabled by the others, and the absence of any one of them would hamstring the power of the others.
D's rich feature set offers many opportunities to a variety of projects, without them being ostensibly related to advanced metaprogramming facilities. High-performance code can be terse and highly optimized without the tedium of repeated coding patterns or hand-written specializations. Highly dynamic code can combine static and dynamic language features in an expressive whole. The best, most innovative ways to use the D language are yet to be discovered.
You can learn more about D's feature set and design at dlang.org"

Debian,https://www.debian.org/,"The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system -- Debian
An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.
Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel.
However, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.
A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.
Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 51000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.
It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together."

FrameNet Brasil at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora,http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/,"FrameNet Brasil (FN-BR) is a Computational Linguistics lab of the Graduate Programs in Linguistics and Computer Sciences at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Brazil. It is also the Brazilian branch of the FrameNet initiative, a global effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. Frame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.
The Database
FN-Br implements a relational database storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes data about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.
The Applications
FN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based annotation tool Webtool, a domain-specific dictionary - the FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary; a system for recommending tourist attractions - m.knob; a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - CARMA."

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.
There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.
In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM."

freifunk,https://freifunk.net,"More and more people are single-handedly installing and maintaining free networks. Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, they can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.
Umbrella Organisation
We act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like Ninux, qaul.net, Guifi.net or WLAN Slovenija and communites developing software we extensivly use like OpenWRT, OLSR, BATMAN, libremesh or retroshare.
Local communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.
Hardware and Software
Most devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with OpenWRT. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. OpenWRT as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk. You can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.
Common freifunk goals
Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information
Reducing the digital divide

"Genes, Genomes and Variation",http://www.ensembl.org,"Ensembl was created alongside the publication of the first draft of the human genome in 2001 to distribute this goldmine of information to scientists across the world. It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.
At the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.
Today, we are a team of nearly 90 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project."
GENIVI Alliance,https://www.genivi.org,"GENIVI® is a nonprofit industry alliance committed to driving the broad adoption of open source, In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) software and providing open technology for the connected car.
GENIVI Alliance, the organization, responsible for introducing Linux and open source software into the in-vehicle, infotainment domain, has successfully delivered several assets through its vehicle domain interaction strategy and is evolving into an alliance integrating multiple, in-vehicle operating systems required for a fully integrated vehicle cockpit.
In recent years GENIVI has focused on the integration challenges in the vehicle and outside, which include in particular cross-domain challenges (safety critical vs. non-critical domains), which brings with it diverse operating systems (Linux, Android, AUTOSAR Adaptive(tm) platform, plus a small handful of remaining proprietary and real-time operating systems).
As the industry moves toward combining multiple vehicle cockpit domains (IVI, cluster, connected devices) into a single silicon solution, often with multiple operating systems, automakers are exploring the concept of a central compute platform, coined by some in the market as cockpit computing.
The alliance provides its members with a global networking community of over 100 companies, joining connected car stakeholders with world-class developers in a collaborative environment, resulting in free, open source middleware as well as open standards for interoperability in diverse systems.
Our work is informed by automotive trends and results in standard interfaces and software that shorten development cycles, speed time to market, and reduce costs for companies adopting and producing automotive solutions."
Gentoo Foundation,http://www.gentoo.org,"Every user has work they need to do. The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.
Put another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.
The goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible."

GNSS-SDR,https://gnss-sdr.org/,"GNSS-SDR is an open source Global Navigation Satellite Systems software receiver, written in C++, that is able to work either from raw signal samples stored in a file, or in real-time with a radio-frequency front-end as signal source, and performs all the signal processing until the observable computation and Position-Velocity-Time solution. Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection. The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB)."

Haskell.Org,http://haskell.org,"Haskell is an advanced, general-purpose, purely functional programming language. It has a strong, static type system with Hindley-Milner type inference.
The language natively supports lazy evaluation, and functions are generally not allowed to have side effects. This leads to a concise and declarative style of programming, which differs quite a bit from conventional languages. By not allowing side effects and dealing with immutable data, the compiler can avoid whole classes of bugs.
Haskell generally compiles to fast, native code, but it can also be compiled to other targets like JavaScript (through GHCJS) or LLVM.
In Google Summer of Code, we attempt to improve not only the language, but the whole ecosystem. This includes (aside from the language itself):
Compilers
Commonly used libraries
Commonly used applications written in Haskell
Profilers, debuggers and other tools
Package managers and infrastructure

InterMine,http://intermine.org/,"What is InterMine?
InterMine integrates data from diverse biological sources, and provides a web-based user interface for querying and analysing the data. Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript.
What technologies do we use?
The InterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.
What sort of data does InterMine have?
Since InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own organisms, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the InterMine Registry to see them all. (The registry was a GSoC project!) Most InterMines also have a ""data sources"" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates.
What kind of problems does InterMine solve?
Genomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! We aim to help scientists make sense of such ambiguity, diversity and complexity.
One way to help is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes?
Code you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, we aim to write code that can be easily deployed on any of them."

What is Lua?
Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.
Lua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.
What is Céu?
Céu provides ""Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming"", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it. Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua."
Libre Space Foundation,https://libre.space,"[Libre Space Foundation] is working on several free software, open hardware and open data projects directly and indirectly related to space applications and technologies while producing open-data and know how for all.
One of the most active Libre Space projects is SatNOGS, the open global satellite ground-station network. It is designed as an open source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station that is accessed via a web page for all of the network users. A basic ground station can be made up of commercial off the shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas. To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing 100+ stations are on-line in the SatNOGS Network and 50+ are tested globally by University cubesat teams, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS DataBase and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.

LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.
We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.
Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.
The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all."

Liquid Galaxy project,https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu,"Liquid Galaxy is a remarkable panoramic system that is tremendously compelling. It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there. Liquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly. The Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open source software both improving its administration and enabling open source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment."
LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,http://llvm.org,"The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.
The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:
The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (""LLVM IR"").
Clang is an ""LLVM native"" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.
The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.
The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.
The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.
The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.
In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks."
LuaRocks,https://luarocks.org,"Lua is a tiny yet powerful programming language, a tiny yet powerful language used anywhere from embedded systems, to AI, to networking, to MMORPGs. The secret to its success is its embeddability: Lua is a tiny portable core than can be adapted to any project.
The flip-side to this is that Lua itself does not come with many libraries, it features only the bare minimum. Enter LuaRocks: by using it to install additional packages called ""rocks"", LuaRocks turbo-charges Lua, making it a suitable language for any field.
The ecosystem
In the luarocks.org repository one can find packages for all sorts of areas. LuaRocks also allows third-party projects to host their own package repositories (either in luarocks.org or in their own servers), so that LuaRocks can work as the plugin manager to their project.

Named Data Networking Project,http://named-data.net/,"While the Internet has far exceeded expectations, it has also stretched initial assumptions, often creating tussles that challenge its underlying communication model. Users and applications operate in terms of content, making it increasingly limiting and difficult to conform to IP’s requirement to communicate by discovering and specifying location. To carry the Internet into the future, a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required, from today’s focus on where — addresses and hosts — to what — the content that users and applications care about.
The Named Data Networking (NDN) project aims to develop a new Internet architecture that can capitalize on strengths — and address weaknesses — of the Internet’s current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth. The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future Internet architecture: routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments, simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed architecture, and is developing specifications and prototype implementations of NDN protocols and applications. NDN Technical Report NDN-0001 “Named Data Networking (NDN) Project” is a slightly modified version of the NDN project proposal.

NV Access,https://www.nvaccess.org/,"For blind people to use a computer, they need a screen reader which reads the text on the screen using a synthetic voice or a braille display. However, in many cases, screen reading software costs more than the computer itself. In the past, this has left computers inaccessible to millions of blind people around the world. This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news.
In April 2006, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, began to develop a free screen reader called NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for use with computers running Microsoft Windows. They then founded the not-for-profit organisation NV Access to support the development of the NVDA screen reader.
NVDA has been translated by volunteers into more than 50 languages, and used by people in more than 120 countries. It has also won multiple awards.

The Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to program robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 https://lab.open-roberta.org/ is online and has had more than 225 000 visits in 2018 across more than 100 countries.
The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the shape of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 10 different robot plugins:
EV3 LEGO Mindstorms
NXT LEGO Mindstorms
BBC micro:bit
Calliope mini
Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based
NAO, a humanoide robot
Bob3
Nepo4Arduino
mBot
SenseBox
Outlook
While the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further."

OpenMRS,https://openmrs.org/,"Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India."
OpenStreetMap,https://www.openstreetmap.org/,"OpenStreetMap is a crowdsourcing project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. Our data is collected by volunteers around the globe largely from scratch and released with an open-content license. We allow free access not only to our map images, but all the underlying map data, which powers websites and apps used by billions of people worldwide.
OSM data can be freely used in both open and closed source software, and has attracted many commercial users. Still, the success of OSM wouldn't be possible without open source software and volunteer developers. The database, website and api running on our own servers, the editing tools used by contributors to improve the map, and many of the most popular libraries and end-user applications within the OSM software ecosystem are all open source software, and developed through a community-driven process.
As our Google Summer of Code participation spans this diverse set of software projects, most of which are maintained as independent efforts under the OSM umbrella, students will encounter a diverse range of programming languages, paradigms and use cases. We hope that we have interesting challenges to offer for any developer, no matter their background!"
OpenWISP,http://openwisp.org,"In the summer of 2008 the Metropolitan City of Rome decided to start a free of charge and public Wi-Fi network to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called ProvinciaWiFi (later renamed WiFi Metropolitano), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing digital divide by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens. From the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium CASPUR (later merged in the CINECA consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the CINECA consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.
The methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to WiFi Metropolitano: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.
The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 wifi controller and different NetJSON implementations used in OpenWISP, are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it."
Oppia Foundation,https://github.com/oppia/oppia,"Why Oppia?
Oppia’s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor.
Interactive learning
Oppia teaches content in small units called explorations. Learners (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.
A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.
Community-driven lesson creation
The other half of Oppia is a community of creators (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative lesson creation among all topic areas.
Come join us!
Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!"

PEcAn Project,http://pecanproject.org,"Why PEcAn?
Climate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change. Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.
How does PEcAn do that?
PEcAn consists of 1) state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.
Transparency, repeatability, accessibility
PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.
High functionality and performance
In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual application that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters. Lastly, we're moving to use software containers to make PEcAn even more light weight and easy to use as well as implementing an API to turn PEcAn into a SaaS product."

Performance Co-Pilot,https://pcp.io,"The Performance Co-Pilot is a toolkit designed for monitoring and managing system-level performance. These services are distributed and scale to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.
PCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows. From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:
PCP Collectors These are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.
PCP Monitors These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed. Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.
The PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely. On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain. All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.
Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients. Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis."

Pitivi,http://pitivi.org/,"Pitivi is a truly unique video editor.
With its ""no downstream hacks"" and ""upstream first"" approach, it acts as a cutting-edge catalyst to push open-source technologies we love forward.
It champions design and usability research: there is no eternal newbie, and Pitivi's user interface is carefully designed to suit both the newcomer and the professional, to be efficient and intuitive. We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.
It is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by longstanding contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.
Ecosystem
Pitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.
The pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. Not only that, but GStreamer is cross-platform, and is also used on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.
In addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can easily use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.
Tooling
The many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies are. Thus you can easily create a working and stable dev env in no time."
PostgreSQL,https://www.postgresql.org,"PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.
PostgreSQL has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set, extensibility, and the dedication of the open source community behind the software to consistently deliver performant and innovative solutions. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems, has been ACID-compliant since 2001, and has powerful add-ons such as the popular PostGIS geospatial database extender. It is no surprise that PostgreSQL has become the open source relational database of choice for many people and organisations.
Getting started with using PostgreSQL has never been easier - pick a project you want to build, and let PostgreSQL safely and robustly store your data."
Project PANOPTES,https://projectpanoptes.org,"A citizen science project which aims to make it easy for anyone to build a low cost, robotic telescope which can be used to detect transiting exoplanets.
The PANOPTES community spans the world, from the founding members in Hawaii to designers, builders and scientists in Europe, Australia, and North and South America. We’re looking forward to our members in Africa and Asia! We use a variety of means to communicate, including a Google Group for announcements and a forum for discussions.
PANOPTES occupies a unique niche in the ongoing search for exoplanets. Previous missions, such as Kepler, have focused primarily on one region of the sky, taking deep images in order to discover transiting exoplanets around mostly distant stars, leading to limited opportunities for imaging follow up as the majority of the targets are far away and dim. Current projects aim to fill this gap by targeting relatively bright and near stars, but continue to utilize expensive equipment and optimal site locations in order to ensure success, thus limiting the ability of the project to grow and adapt.
PANOPTES is attractive because it can complement these missions, doing so cheaply and with the involvement of citizen scientists. And while the primary scientific interest of the PANOPTES project is to aid in the discovery of exoplanets via the transit-detection technique, PANOPTES is also a platform. We encourage other groups to come up with projects which use PANOPTES data, hardware or software to address other scientific questions, such as supernovae, near-earth objects (NEO), space debris, and more. It is the hope of the project that schools will come up with novel ways to utilize the unit and the data it gathers."

Purr data has a special emphasis on generating audio and/or video in real time, with low latency. Much of its design focuses on receiving, manipulating, and delivering high-quality audio signals. Specifically, the software addresses the problem of doing this efficiently and reliably on general purpose operating systems like OSX, Windows, Debian, etc.-- i.e., systems designed mainly for multi-tasking.
Purr Data builds on code from several other software projects: Pure Data-- which is the audio and scripting engine, Pd-extended-- which is a now abandoned application that shipped Pure Data with lots of external libraries, and Pd-l2ork-- which added long-needed usability enhancements like infinite-undo and native state-saving mechanisms to Pure Data.

R project for statistical computing,https://www.r-project.org/,"R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes
an effective data handling and storage facility,
a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.
The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.
R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.
Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.
R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy."

Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis.
Red Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.
For GSoC 2019, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

SciRuby consists of a fairly large number of gems, including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, rubex, rbcuda, and NMatrix.
NMatrix has been awarded grants by the Ruby Association in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. Statsample and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while daru, nyaplot and gnuplotrb take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was awarded the Ruby Association Grant in 2014, Rubex and tensorflow.rb received it in 2016 and RbCUDA in 2017.
Working on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. In fact, all the grants issued by the Ruby Association (which is headed by Matz) in 2016 (and most in 2017) have gone to scientific projects.
Since we are first and foremost a science-related project, we expect successful student projects to lead to publications. Better yet, students might get to see their code go into orbit, or used to save lives in biomedical research."
SageMath,https://www.sagemath.org/,"Mathematicians, scientists, researchers, and students need a powerful tool for their work or study. SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.
The mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.
Python is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.
Almost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics."

ScummVM,http://www.scummvm.org,"Since 2014, ScummVM acts as a GSoC umbrella for game preservation projects, such as its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.
ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. The project started in 2001 and we recently widened our scope to RPG engines.
ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.
ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.
ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed."

SymbiFlow,https://symbiflow.github.io,"SymbiFlow is a group of projects aiming to dramatically broaden the outreach of FPGA platforms and lower entry barriers into FPGA development for both professional engineers and hobbyists by providing a completely FOSS flow for developing FPGA IP.
We believe FPGAs are an exciting and versatile development platform that could be used for addressing a variety of complex tasks, from flexible parallel I/O, through camera interfacing, low-latency machine learning, hardware glue logic to general hardware-accelerated parallel processing, in a much broader number of scenarios than today. A big roadblock to wider adoption are the specific tools that need to be learned on a per-vendor basis and their proprietary licensing.
By working to implement a vendor neutral and modular flow that is easy to integrate with various types of other tools, and more closely corresponds to a development experience known to the wider software development community ever since GCC was created, SymbiFlow is meant to drastically accelerate software-driven innovation in FPGA development.
SymbiFlow is already enabling new tools, development platforms and communities that build around the end-to-end open flow that is already working for some platforms. But there is still a lot of work ahead!
To achieve SymbiFlow's goal of a complete FOSS FPGA toolchain, a number of tools and projects are necessary to provide all the needed components of an end-to-end flow. Thus, SymbiFlow serves as an umbrella project for several activities, the central of which pertains to the creation of so-called FPGA ""architecture definitions"", i.e. documentation of how specific FPGAs work internally.
Those definitions and serve as input to open source backend tools like nextpnr and Verilog to Routing, and frontend tools like Yosys. They are created within separate collaborating projects targeting different FPGAs - Project X-Ray for Xilinx 7-Series, Project IceStorm for Lattice iCE40 and Project Trellis for Lattice ECP5 FPGAs."

Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 220 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media."
The Perl Foundation,https://perlfoundation.org,"The Perl Foundation was founded as Yet Another Society to coordinate the efforts of numerous grass-roots Perl-based groups including International Perl Conferences (TPC/YAPC/EPC/PerlCon), the many Perl members organisations, projects, workshops and meetups. The Perl Foundation carries the legal responsibility Perl languages and websites.
Our desire is to further enhance learning of programmers of the Perl and the understanding of the Perl ecosystem and community.
Perl is an established family of languages (Perl 5 and Perl 6) that is part of almost every Linux/UNIX distribution and prevalent on may others.
We have a long history of participation in the Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in which has resulted in very successful applications and experiences. Almost all of the GSoC students have become well known Perl programmers and some have gone on to help organise international conferences in the Perl community along with developing projects, libraries and modules. The main remit of the Perl Foundation is to:
Cultivate a collaborative open source community and an ecosystem of computer language implementations collectively known as ""Perl""
Foster the creation of complementary tools, libraries, extensions, and applications around Perl
Promoting Perl to members of the general public through the use of open source licensing
Educating members of the general public in the application of Perl
Advancing Perl through scientific research and development
Receiving and administering funds to aid, support and assist by gifts, grants, contributions or otherwise other persons or organizations of any kind, provided that such activities are consistent with the foregoing purposes.
The Perl Foundation supports a large number of online, and offline, resources and meetings to further enhance Perl as a valuable language in the modern programmer's toolbox."
The Postgres Operator,https://github.com/zalando-incubator/postgres-operator,"The Postgres operator manages PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes::
The operator watches additions, updates, and deletions of PostgreSQL cluster manifests and changes the running clusters accordingly. For example, when a user submits a new manifest, the operator fetches that manifest and spawns a new Postgres cluster along with all necessary entities such as Kubernetes StatefulSets and Postgres roles.
The operator also watches updates to its own configuration and alters running Postgres clusters if necessary. For instance, if a pod docker image is changed, the operator carries out the rolling update. That is, the operator re-spawns one-by-one pods of each Postgres cluster it manages with the new Docker image.
Finally, the operator periodically synchronizes the actual state of each Postgres cluster with the desired state defined in the cluster's manifest."
The Processing Foundation,http://processingfoundation.org,"The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.
We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes Processing (Java), p5.js (JavaScript), and Processing.py (Python), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.
The Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or disability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.
At our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today."
The Terasology Foundation,https://terasology.org/,"The Organization
The Terasology Foundation hosts Terasology, DestinationSol, and a series of related work aimed at making game development in Java easy and fun
After participating in programs like GSOC and GCI for years we've become a registered non-profit (previously we went by ""MovingBlocks""), and look forward to years more of educational awareness, challenging architecture, powerful developer workspaces, fun content, and much more
Our contributors are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians of all ages. We encourage and appreciate contributions from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to newcomers
Our Games
Terasology is a highly extensible open source voxel-based game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world
From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and modular game. We host a large amount of game content modules under the Terasology organization on GitHub, all community maintained. We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on IRC, Discord, or Slack.
Destination Sol is a fun little space arcade shooter we adopted as open source to learn more about LibGDX, releasing on Steam and Google Play, and to have somewhere to apply our frameworks.
Architecture
Our engine is meant to be light, secure, and flexible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. Game distributions then include modules that provide basic gameplay.
Content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates. Creating a new module is as easy as running a single command, same for fetching source for any existing community module.
The game itself can auto-download modules if needed with full dependency resolution included!"
The Vega Project at the University of Washington,http://vega.github.io/,"Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data. The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design. This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams. On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis. With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. Tools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter."

Tungsten Fabric,https://tungsten.io,"Many clouds
This is now a multicloud world. Companies are developing applications designed to work in the cloud (cloud native), but are finding that there isn't a single cloud offering that meets all of their requirements. Combinations of private and public clouds (hybrid multicloud) are necessary to deliver the services required for their business needs.
Maintaining the communication between all of these clouds (the network fabric) can be complicated. Each one can have its own APIs and policies. Making sure everything stays up to date and secure is time consuming and error prone.
That's where we come in.
One (Tungsten) Fabric
Tungsten Fabric is a secure software defined networking project designed for the cloud native, multicloud environment. Placing it on top of any IP network allows you to have a single portal for defining, monitoring, and analyzing your entire multicloud network, its security, and its performance.
Using Tungsten Fabric, you can write and deploy network and security policies that are portable to any cloud environment. All of your clouds can have a consistent and easily maintainable configuration. Standardized policies will make your security team happy, too.
Internet scale
Tungsten Fabric is designed from the ground up to be as fast, as secure, and as scaleable as you need. From small private networks to Tier 1 ISPs, Tungsten Fabric can handle it…and we have users and contributors from both and everything in between! Working with Tungsten Fabric will give you a lot of experience with and knowledge about our industry.

UCSC Xena,http://xena.ucsc.edu,"UCSC Xena helps biologists, both with and without computation skills, to visualize and analyze cancer genomics datasets. Our web-based data browser enables cancer researchers around the world to discover trends and test their hypotheses. Unique in the medical genomics research field, we allow users to easily view both large public resources generated by consortium around the world AND their own data or data from a publication. We accomplish this using a decoupled server-client architecture, where data is distributed across both public and private servers while being securely combined and visualized in one web-based browser.
While we are funded nationally by NCI, our users are international, with only ~40% of our traffic coming from the United States. We are committed to open-source software and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our static interval tree[http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree] and KM statistics[http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier]).
Students we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger UCSC Genomics Institute[https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/], whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease.
We aim to ensure that our students gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and code to the project. We are committed to putting the code from students out to production and into the world where it is used by real cancer researchers. In addition, we are always looking for long-term collaborators and growing our development team. If you're interested in doing your Google Summer of Code project on cancer genomics, statistics, data visualization, or functional programing, let us know!

webpack,https://webpack.js.org/,"webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
Overview
Currently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).
What makes webpack unique?
Extensibility webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.
Focused around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as ""code splitting"". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.
Built in JavaScript webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.
Used at Scale webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.
Community Owned webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling."

X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.
Today, as a result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with applications, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.

ZynAddSubFX,http://zynaddsubfx.sf.net,"What is ZynAddSubFX?
ZynAddSubFX is a cross platform synthesizer which provides a wide range of functionality to go from a basic oscillator to a full virtual musical instrument. A quick overview of some features includes:
Polyphonic with support for legato and mono playing modes
Three synthesizer engines:
Additive Synthesis for classic synth sounds composed of a variety of voices with powerful modulation. This exposes modulators ranging from LFOs and envelopes to oscillator modulators for FM, PM, and AM.
Subtractive Synthesis for creating variable bandwidth harmonics from filtered white noise
PAD synthesis for creating beautiful pads and other instruments
Powerful waveform generator with up to 128 sine/non-sine harmonics
A variety of filters including analogue modeled filters, formant filters, and state variable filters.
Envelopes can have ADSR (or ASR, etc..) modes or can be free modes (with any shape)
Effects for Reverb, Echo, Chorus/Flange, Phasing, Wave-shaping, Equalizing, Dynamic Filtering with flexible signal routing
A custom Ruby based window toolkit for optimal embeddability and scriptability
What makes ZynAddSubFX different?
Compared to other audio synthesis applications ZynAddSubFX offers a large number of simple building blocks in a mostly fixed signal routing. Each component on it's own is easy to understand, but once all the components interact, then new sounds can emerge and interesting modulation possibilities open up. Overall there are millions of parameters which can be manipulated from the user interface or via the open sound control API. With the collection of building blocks provided to users a powerful sound design tool is provided along with an interesting variety of development challenges. The challenges range from workflow issues, to signal processing trade-offs, to user interface refinements, and more."
