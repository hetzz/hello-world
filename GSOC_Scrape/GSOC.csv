Open Source for Open Source
AboutCode is a set of open source tools to discover and manage important information about your software. Our primary focus is to solve the problem of discovering, identifying, tracking and managing open source and third-party components used in your products, applications and systems. The AboutCode tools are designed to be modular so that a software development team can quickly implement a workflow tailored for its set of languages, technologies and tools."

We are AerospaceResearch.net, a small team of space makers solving space problems together with the Small Satellite Student Society University of Stuttgart (KSat e.V.) and the ep2lab of Charles III University of Madrid.
In 2011, we started as a student group at the University of Stuttgart to provide massive computing power with our distributed computting platform Constellation to everyone needing it for space simulations. Over time, we attracted international young professionals of the space industry and the local maker community and thus becoming a full fletched citizen science project.
We are a community of several different Teams in Stuttgart and globally working together on space projects. Together with KSat e.V. (the Small Satellite Student Society) from the University of Stuttgart and the Distributed Ground Station Network Team at the Institute for Photogrammetry we are working on the rover mission ROACH crawling for maintenance reasons on the outer hull of a sounding rocket while coasting in near space or tracking cubesats faster than US NORAD. With the Cosmic Dust Team of the Institute for Space Systems at University of Stuttgart we are simulating cometary dust particles for the IMEX project of the European Space Agency (ESA). And now with our newest umbrella team, the ep2lab of Charles III University of Madrid, we are also involved in simulating and building propulsion systems for space applications.
We are a small organization but having impact within our space community by helping realizing space exploration by creativity and open access. We are open for everybody interested in space for the betterment of everybody. We believe everyone can be involved in space and making space together!"
