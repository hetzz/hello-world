One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. For example, our web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell.\\nOur technologies have broad impact in education: Traditional didactic and textbook-based learning formats utilized in many life sciences courses create an environment that limits student ability to develop highly needed technical skills and fully conceptualize the complex and dynamic nature of biology and diseases. To address these challenges, our software technologies enable students ranging from high schools to undergraduate and graduate levels to learn about biology and diseases using by building, simulating, breaking, and re-analyzing computational models of these biological systems.\\nOther technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc. Our group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.'],\n",

Idiomatic D programs are commonly as fast as hand-optimized C code, while being reportedly shorter and easier to write, read, and change. A gradual approach to memory safety allows safe programs to be largely automatically checked, whilst relying on small and fast manually-verified primitives.\\nMetaprogramming in the D language relies on three core features. First, compile-time evaluation allows user code to evaluate most D code (except calls into opaque functions or certain casts) during compilation. This allows for unparalleled compile-time processing abilities, without the need to learn a different metalanguage. Second, static introspection allows D artifacts (such as modules, types, functions) to be inspected during compilation. This allows for component designs that adapt to one another at assemblage time, eliminating the rigidity of fixed interfaces - a paradigm becoming increasingly known as \"Design by Introspection\". Third, the D language allows strings computed during compilation to be fed back to the compiler. This allows arbitrarily complex code to be built from compact specifications such as regular expressions, EBNF/PEG grammars, SQL, automata, and many other DSLs. Each of these three pillars is enabled by the others, and the absence of any one of them would hamstring the power of the others.\\nD\\'s rich feature set offers many opportunities to a variety of projects, without them being ostensibly related to advanced metaprogramming facilities. High-performance code can be terse and highly optimized without the tedium of repeated coding patterns or hand-written specializations. Highly dynamic code can combine static and dynamic language features in an expressive whole.

Use Kapitan to manage your Kubernetes manifests, your documentation, your Terraform configuration or even simplify your scripts for multiple environments. Kapitan introduces the notion of an inventory which contains all your (environment or code) variables. Based on those variables you can then build your infrastructure conditionally to fit every kind of environment or code you want to deploy. If you like tinkering with your linux shell configurations or use ansible, puppet or chef to manage deployments you will enjoy the power of Kapitan.'],\n",

It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe\\'s Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\\nWhat is Céu?\\nCéu provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it. Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.'],\n",

It is designed as an open source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station that is accessed via a web page for all of the network users. A basic ground station can be made up of commercial off the shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas. To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing 100+ stations are on-line in the SatNOGS Network and 50+ are tested globally by University cubesat teams, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS DataBase and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.\\nLibre Space together with the University of Patras are also the makers of UPSat, the 1st free software, open-hardware cubesat.\\nLibre Space Foundation is also implementing the European Space Agency activity SDR Maker Space working on several open-source Software Defined Radio sub-activities, to facilitate satellite communications.']]"
